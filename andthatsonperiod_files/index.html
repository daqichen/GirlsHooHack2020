                    During puberty, the brain undergoes many changes. The hormones estrogen and
                    progesterone increase in production which causes more growth of body hair, 
                    moodiness, and development of breasts. Puberty and the reproductive system 
                    are controlled by the hormones of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis. The 
                    hypothalamus releases Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile manner, which 
                    stimulates the release of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) 
                    from the anterior pituitary gland.

                  Acne is a skin condition that shows up as different types of bumps. 
                  They include whiteheads, blackheads, red bumps (pimples), and bumps 
                  that are filled with pus (called pustules). What causes these annoying 
                  bumps? Well, your skin is covered with tiny holes called hair follicles, 
                  or pores. Pores contain sebaceous (say: suh-BAY-shus) glands (also called 
                  oil glands) that make sebum (say: SEE-bum), an oil that moistens your 
                  hair and skin.

              <a class="pic-caption" href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/health/breast-development">
                As your breasts first start to grow, they can be very tender and sore. They may also itch as your skin gets stretched.
                Buying a first bra can help protect new breast growth and minimize pain. If the breasts grow rapidly, stretch marks may occur in the skin. 
                These will fade over time.
                The breasts will continue to grow as the girl’s body fat increases during puberty. They become rounder and fuller.
                The areola (the area around the nipple) may get darker and larger and the nipple may become erect, or stick out. 
                It’s common for one breast to develop faster than the other. Over time it should even out, 
                however many adult women find their breasts differ very slightly in size. This is completely normal.

                The onset of puberty is marked by an increase in the dimensions of the uterus and in endometrial thickness, 
                but also by a change in the shape of the uterus from a tubular to a pear shaped organ. Puberty also marks the beginning of a
                girl's period which you can read more about later on in the "First Period" section.

                Puberty marks the time when hair starts to thicken or grow in areas where no hair grew before. 
                Girls can expect hair to thicken on the legs and grow in the armpits and genital area.
                The hair doesn’t grow and thicken all at once but in stages that vary from person to person.

            <h3>Body Image</h3>
            <p>
              Puberty can cause an increase in body image problems. During puberty, the body will naturally gain weight an put on more fat in certain areas of the body. This can cause problems with negatively viewing one's developing body. 
            </p>              
            <p> 
              In order to cope with this weight gain, focus on creating healthy habits, such as eating well and exercising regularly. It is important to recognize that this weight gain is completely natural and not something to be ashamed of.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Another development during puberty is that acne and increased body hair begin to show up. Acne is a big cause of insecurity in developing girls, but it is a completely normal part of development. A healthy diet and exercise, as well as staying well-hydrated can help in preventing acne from getting worse.

            <h3>First Period</h3>
            <p>
              Most people start their periods between the ages of 12 and 13.
              However, it’s normal to start your period a little earlier or later, too.
              As a general rule of thumb, menstruation will start about two years after your breasts begin to develop.
              Some people start their periods without any warning. 
              Others may experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the days leading up to their period.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Your first period will only last a few days.
              It may take a couple of months for your period to settle into a regular schedule and consistency.
              Once it does, your period may last anywhere from two to seven days each month.
              Although a person’s first few periods are often light — bringing a few spots of red-brown blood throughout the week — you may have a heavier flow.
              Your monthly period will follow a more consistent pattern once your hormones stabilize.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have several different options you can use to stop the bleeding. You may need to try a few different types before you find what works best for you.
              Sanitary pads are rectangular pieces of absorbent material that you stick inside your underwear.
              All pads have a sticky strip on the bottom. That’s what attaches the pad to your underwear.
              Some have extra material on the sides, known as “wings,” that you fold over the edges of your underwear. This helps keep the pad in place.
              They come in different sizes. Each size is made to accommodate a different level of bleeding.
              Tampons are absorbent, tubelike menstrual products. They’re inserted into the vagina so they can absorb menstrual fluid before it reaches your underwear.
              As with pads, tampons come in different sizes and overall absorbencies.
              Menstrual cups are another option. Similar to tampons, cups are inserted into the vagina where they collect blood before it exits the body.

                  As a single father, it’s been a bit hard finding a way to relate to my daughter and have the conversations that need to be had as she begins to grow up more. This program has helped me to know that my daughter has a strong female figure to look up to, and I have already seen her confidence grow from having such an amazing Big Sister.

                This Big Sister program was very helpful for me, and it gave me the opportunity to meet one of my now best friends. My Big Sister, Priyanka, was amazing and a really good resource to talk to when I had questions about all of the changes that were happening during my life at that time. That experience also made me want to become a Big Sister, so that I can be as helpful to someone else as my Big Sister was for me!

                When my daughter showed me this program and said that she wanted to join it, I was sort of wary at first. However, I could not be more happy that I said yes to her because now she has an extra support system to help her in a period of time that I know can be hard for so many girls. Knowing that she has someone closer to her age that she can talk about her problems with is so reassuring for me as a mother
